DO WHAT THE F*CK DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

This is a free, unencumbered software project that provides value to others without restriction. I'm not responsible for anything you do with it.

DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH THIS SOFTWARE, BUT:

- DON'T COMPLAIN. Life is too short for that.
- BE NICE TO OTHERS. If you don't like something, constructive criticism is welcome.
- DON'T BE AN ELITIST. Treat everyone with respect.

This software was designed from the start to be maximally useful. If you think it sucks or is a waste of time, feel free to improve it but don't complain that it's too simple or that you spent a lot of time creating something basic. The complexity is there for the advanced use cases that need power and flexibility.

DO WHAT THE F*CK DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

I'll happily accept patches, bug reports, and feature requests. I'll do my best to fix issues and add useful features. I won't promise to implement everything, but I'll do what I can with the time and skills I have.

THE GOAL IS RESEARCH EXCELLENCE

- Quality: Deep, thorough research with multiple AI agents collaborating
- Architecture: Multi-agent system with clear separation of concerns
- User Experience: Dark, professional interface with real-time feedback
